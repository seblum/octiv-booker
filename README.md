# Before you start
## Add crendentials of ZHS account
In the root directory, create a file "userdata.py" with two variables as follows:
```
username = "<yourusername>"
userpassword = "<yourpassword>"
```
## Make browser driver available
(Tested in Windows; might differ for other systems)

The script relies on starting a browser; currently Firefox. In order for the script to be able to start Firefox, it needs to know the location of the driver.
- Download latest version of the Firefox driver (geckodriver) from: https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases
- Save geckodriver.exe to a folder of your choice and add this folder to the Path variable:

![path](readme_images/path2.png)
![path](readme_images/path3.png)

# Setup automated runs
## Create Batch File to Run the Python Script
A .bat file can be used to open a command line and run the python script.

- Open a text editor, insert the following and replace placeholders with your paths:
```
"<Path where your Python exe is stored\python.exe>" "<Path where your Python script is stored\script name.py>"
pause
```
Notes: Quotes need to be included; _pause_ does not close the command window automatically after the script is finished so that the output can be read.

- Save the file as a .bat file.

![bat file](readme_images/bat-file.png)

A double klick on the bat file should open a command line and start the script.
